The original source KML had its namespace changed
from 2.1 to 2.2 without validation.  It fails
to validate against 2.2 because incompatible changes
were made to KML 2.2 schema making it stricter
in a number of places (e.g. changing xsd:all to
xsd:sequence in LookAt).

The namespace was changed back to 2.1 to make it validate.
